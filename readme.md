This is a simple soundboard built for fun. Functionality initially:

1: Load and play any wav or mp3 file
2: Load and save board states

Planned features:
1: Transition to pygame or pyarcade instead of tkinter for UI
2: Improve UI
3: Stop sounds that are playing
4: Package into .exe
5: Potentially package as an adroid or iOS app
